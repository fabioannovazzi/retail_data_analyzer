Retail data clean-up and analysis
Retail data, also known as sell-out data, as syndicated data, and as CPG data, contains informations about sell-out sales of a given category in a given market. It is generally consolidated by a third party organization, and can be used only under specific conditions. 
This repository contains three python notebooks which contain only code and do not contain any data. To make use of the notebooks you will need to provide your own syndicated data and modify the relevant parameters. 
The first notebook simplifies the cleanup and normalization of retail data files. 
The second notebook generates reports
The third notebook generates statistical visualizations.
