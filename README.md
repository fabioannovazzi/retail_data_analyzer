Retail data clean-up and analysis.

Retail data, also known as sell-out data, as syndicated data, and as CPG data, contains information about sell-out sales of a given category in a given market. It is generally consolidated by a third party organization, and can be used only under specific contractual conditions. 

This repository contain only code- It does not contain any real retail data. To make use of the notebooks you will need to provide your own retail data and modify the relevant parameters accordingly. 

Specifically, it contains three python notebooks:

- the first notebook simplifies the cleanup and normalization of retail data files. 

- the second notebook generates reports

- the third notebook generates statistical visualizations.

If you run the third notebook it will automatically load a randomized dataset, and generate example charts. Please note that all values in the charts are completely random. 

The plotting_guide pdf file contains (uncomplete) instructions on how to use the notebooks.
